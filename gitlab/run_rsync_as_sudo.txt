https://askubuntu.com/questions/719439/using-rsync-with-sudo-on-the-destination-machine

On the destination machine

    Find out the path to rsync: which rsync
    Edit the /etc/sudoers file: sudo visudo (see also: must I use visudo?)
    Add the line <username> ALL=NOPASSWD:<path to rsync>, where username is the login name of the user that rsync will use to log on. That user must be able to use sudo

Then, on the source machine, specify that sudo rsync shall be used:

rsync ... --rsync-path="sudo rsync" ...

Using it without the NOPASSWD on the destination machine will result in the message

    sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified
