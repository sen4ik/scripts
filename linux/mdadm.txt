# I had an issue with md device not autostarting after reboot. Below is how I resolved it.

# Use fdisk to kill all the partitions and create freshpartition on each disk.
sudo fdisk /dev/sdx
# in fdsik do the d, g, n, w

# Now you might need to clear the superblocks even though this never worked for me. I just skipped this step. mdadm uses superblock to assemble the array after reboot.

# When creating the raid, use the partitions instead of disks.
sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=0 --raid-devices=6 /dev/sdf1 /dev/sdg1 /dev/sdao1 /dev/sday1 /dev/sdaz1 /dev/sdba1

# That worked for me.
