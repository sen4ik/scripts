1) Open Grid Hub port for AWS instance. Modify security group to allow inbound traffic on port 4444.
2) If you want to be able to access grid nodes using VNC, you need to open additional ports. In our case those ports are 5901-5931.
3) Make sure server uses proper timezone. Use 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata' command.
If everything setup correctly, you should be able to access Grib Hub console at http://{{INSTANCE_IP}}:4444/grid/console
